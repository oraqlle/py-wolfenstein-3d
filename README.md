# Pygame + ModernGL Quad Render

Basic quad renderer setup using Pygame and ModernGL for porting into specific game or
game engine.

## Building and Running

To build and run the game you will need a Python installation and the `venv` module.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Source

This set up is based on the set up used in the tutorials by [Coder Space]()
with some opinionated small QOL changes. As such, the code is licensed the same as the
original projects this is from.
