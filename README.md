# Wolfenstein 3D Clone

This is a replica of Wolfenstein 3D in Pygame using OpenGL.

This project was written to assist in my understanding of game engines and computer
graphics.

## Source

This engine was created following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJXuvK_eLrQ)
from Coder Space. Documentation is based on the techniques demonstrated in the video, for
my own record and for others further understanding. This project is licensed the same as
the source created by the original author.
